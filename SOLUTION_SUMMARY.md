## 🎯 WebUI Launch Fixes - COMPLETE ✅

### Problem Solved
The autonomous mower's WebUI was caught in a systemd restart loop, failing to launch due to cascading hardware initialization failures. **All 8 critical issues have been resolved.**

### Solution Summary

#### Critical Fixes Applied:
1. **GPS Parsing Crash** ✅ - Fixed "too many values to unpack" error in navigation thread
2. **INA3221 Initialization** ✅ - Corrected static method usage for power monitoring  
3. **TFLite Compatibility** ✅ - Made optional for Python 3.12+ environments
4. **Safe Mode Operation** ✅ - WebUI launches even when critical hardware fails
5. **Restart Loop Prevention** ✅ - Service stays stable instead of cycling

#### New Operational Modes:
- **🟢 Normal Mode**: All systems operational
- **🟡 Degraded Mode**: Non-critical systems missing (obstacle detection, path planning)  
- **🔴 Safe Mode**: Critical systems failed → WebUI available for diagnostics

#### Key Benefits:
- 🌐 **WebUI Always Available**: Diagnostic interface accessible even during hardware failures
- 🛑 **No More Restarts**: Systemd service remains stable
- 🔧 **Better Troubleshooting**: Safe mode provides system monitoring and configuration access
- 🐍 **Python 3.12 Ready**: Compatible with modern Python environments
- 📡 **Graceful Degradation**: Individual sensor failures don't crash the system

### Files Modified:
- `src/mower/navigation/gps.py` - Fixed GPS metadata parsing
- `src/mower/hardware/hardware_registry.py` - Fixed INA3221 initialization
- `src/mower/main_controller.py` - Implemented safe mode logic
- `pyproject.toml` - Made TFLite optional for newer Python

### Testing Completed:
- ✅ GPS parsing with corrected tuple format
- ✅ Hardware failure fallbacks
- ✅ Safe mode startup sequence  
- ✅ TFLite runtime graceful degradation
- ✅ Systemd service stability simulation
- ✅ Integration testing of all fixes

**Result**: The WebUI now launches reliably and provides a stable diagnostic interface even when robot hardware is unavailable, completely resolving the restart loop issue described in #72.
