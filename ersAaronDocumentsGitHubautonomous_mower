    Switch from Leaflet to Google Maps in web UI.
    
    Replaced Leaflet with Google Maps for rendering and drawing areas and patterns. Adjusted styling, interactions, and event handlers to support Google Maps API. This change improves scalability and integrates additional mapping functionalities like editable polygons and customized markers.
