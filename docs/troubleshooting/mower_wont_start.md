- The mower shows error messages during startup

## Possible Causes and Solutions

### 1. Power Issues

#### Battery is depleted

**Symptoms:**
- No response when power button is pressed
- No LED indicators light up

**Solutions:**
1. Connect the mower to the charging station
2. Ensure the charging station is properly connected to power
3. Wait at least 30 minutes for the battery to gain enough charge to start
4. Try powering on the mower again

#### Battery connection issues

**Symptoms:**
- Intermittent power
- Mower powers on but quickly shuts off

**Solutions:**
1. Power off the mower
2. Open the battery compartment (refer to the user manual for instructions)
3. Check that the battery connections are secure
4. Close the battery compartment
5. Try powering on the mower again

#### Power button malfunction

**Symptoms:**
- Power button feels different when pressed
- No click or feedback when pressing the button

**Solutions:**
1. Try holding the power button for a longer period (5-10 seconds)
2. If available, try the alternative power method (refer to the user manual)
3. Contact support if the issue persists

### 2. Initialization Issues

#### System initialization failure

**Symptoms:**
- Mower powers on but LED indicators show an error pattern
- Mower displays an error message during startup

**Solutions:**
1. Power off the mower
2. Wait 30 seconds
3. Power on the mower again
4. If the issue persists, try a hardware reset (see [Hardware Reset](hardware_reset.md))

#### Software corruption

**Symptoms:**
- Mower starts but gets stuck during initialization
- Error messages related to software or firmware

**Solutions:**
1. Check for available software updates (see [Software Updates](../user_guides/software_updates.md))
2. If updates are available, install them
3. If the issue persists, try a factory reset (see [Factory Reset](factory_reset.md))

#### Sensor initialization failure

**Symptoms:**
- Error messages related to specific sensors
- LED indicators show a specific error pattern

**Solutions:**
1. Check that all sensors are clean and unobstructed
2. Run the hardware diagnostics (see [Hardware Diagnostics](hardware_diagnostics.md))
3. If specific sensors are identified as faulty, they may need to be replaced or repaired

### 3. Environmental Issues

#### Temperature out of range

**Symptoms:**
- Error message indicating temperature is out of operating range
- Mower won't start in very cold or hot conditions

**Solutions:**
1. Move the mower to an environment within the operating temperature range (0째C to 40째C or 32째F to 104째F)
2. Allow the mower to acclimate to the new temperature for at least 30 minutes
3. Try powering on the mower again

#### Water or moisture damage

**Symptoms:**
- Mower was recently exposed to heavy rain or water
- Visible moisture or condensation

**Solutions:**
1. Ensure the mower is completely dry
2. If water exposure is suspected, do not attempt to power on the mower
3. Allow the mower to dry in a warm, dry place for at least 24 hours
4. If the issue persists after drying, contact support

## Diagnostic Steps

If the above solutions don't resolve the issue, follow these diagnostic steps:

1. **Check the LED indicators**: Note any patterns or colors displayed
2. **Check the display**: Note any error messages or codes
3. **Check the log files**: If you can access the web interface, check the log files for error messages (see [Log Files](log_files.md))
4. **Run diagnostics**: If possible, run the hardware and software diagnostics (see [Hardware Diagnostics](hardware_diagnostics.md) and [Software Diagnostics](software_diagnostics.md))

## When to Contact Support

Contact support if:
- You've tried all the above solutions and the mower still won't start
- You see error codes that aren't documented
- You suspect hardware failure
- The mower shows signs of physical damage

See [Contacting Support](contacting_support.md) for information on how to contact support.

## Prevention

To prevent startup issues in the future:
- Keep the mower's battery charged
- Store the mower in a dry, temperature-controlled environment
- Keep the mower clean and free of debris
- Regularly update the mower's software
- Perform regular maintenance as described in the user manual
