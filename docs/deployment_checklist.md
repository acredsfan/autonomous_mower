# Autonomous Mower Deployment Checklist

This document tracks the progress of preparing the autonomous mower codebase for deployment to a Raspberry Pi for testing.

## Duplicate Code Consolidation

- [ ] Identify and resolve duplicate files
- [ ] Identify and resolve duplicate functions
- [ ] Consolidate similar functionality across files

## Raspberry Pi Compatibility

- [ ] Verify GPIO pin configurations
- [ ] Check hardware dependencies
- [ ] Ensure proper permissions for hardware access
- [ ] Verify path configurations are appropriate for Raspberry Pi

## Deployment Preparation

- [ ] Verify all dependencies are listed in requirements.txt
- [ ] Check for any hardcoded paths that might cause issues
- [ ] Ensure logging is properly configured
- [ ] Verify error handling for hardware failures
- [ ] Test startup and shutdown procedures

## Testing

- [ ] Create a test plan for Raspberry Pi deployment
- [ ] Prepare test cases for hardware integration
- [ ] Document expected behavior for each test case

## Documentation

- [ ] Update README.md with Raspberry Pi deployment instructions
- [ ] Document any Raspberry Pi-specific configurations
- [ ] Create troubleshooting guide for common deployment issues
