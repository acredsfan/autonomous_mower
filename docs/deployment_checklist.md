# Autonomous Mower Deployment Checklist

This document tracks the progress of preparing the autonomous mower codebase for deployment to a Raspberry Pi for testing.

## Duplicate Code Consolidation

- [x] Identify and resolve duplicate files
- [x] Identify and resolve duplicate functions
- [x] Consolidate similar functionality across files

### Consolidation Plan for robot.py and robot_di.py

1. **Current Status**:
   - robot.py: Simple implementation with global functions, currently used in the project
   - robot_di.py: Better implementation with dependency injection, not actively used

2. **Consolidation Steps**:
   - Rename robot_di.py to robot_new.py to avoid confusion
   - Update the Robot class in robot_new.py to ensure it matches the interface expected by the rest of the codebase
   - Fix the import in test_simulation_mode.py to use the correct class name
   - Update mower.py to import from robot_new.py instead of robot.py
   - Test the changes to ensure everything works correctly
   - Once verified, remove robot.py and rename robot_new.py to robot.py

## Raspberry Pi Compatibility

- [x] Verify GPIO pin configurations
- [x] Check hardware dependencies
- [x] Ensure proper permissions for hardware access
- [x] Verify path configurations are appropriate for Raspberry Pi

### Raspberry Pi Compatibility Notes

1. **GPIO Configuration**:
   - GPIO management is handled by the GPIOManager class
   - Pin mappings are documented in "Raspberry Pi GPIO.xlsx"
   - Installation scripts set up proper udev rules for GPIO access

2. **Hardware Dependencies**:
   - Required Python packages are listed in requirements.txt, including RPi.GPIO
   - Hardware interfaces are properly abstracted with adapter classes
   - Simulation mode is available for testing without hardware

3. **Path Configurations**:
   - Serial device paths are configured with environment variables:
     - GPS: /dev/ttyAMA0 (configurable via GPS_SERIAL_PORT)
     - RoboHAT MM1: /dev/ttyACM1 (configurable via MM1_SERIAL_PORT)
     - IMU: /dev/ttyAMA2 (configurable via IMU_SERIAL_PORT)
   - Default paths should be verified on the specific Raspberry Pi model being used

## Deployment Preparation

- [x] Verify all dependencies are listed in requirements.txt
- [x] Check for any hardcoded paths that might cause issues
- [x] Ensure logging is properly configured
- [x] Verify error handling for hardware failures
- [x] Test startup and shutdown procedures

### Deployment Preparation Notes

1. **Dependencies**:
   - All required dependencies are listed in requirements.txt
   - RPi.GPIO is included for Raspberry Pi GPIO access
   - Installation script (install_requirements.sh) is provided to set up the environment

2. **Logging Configuration**:
   - Logging is configured in utilities/logger_config.py
   - Log rotation is set up with 5 backup files
   - Logs are stored in the project root directory

3. **Error Handling**:
   - Error handling for hardware failures is implemented in error_handling module
   - ResourceManager in mower.py includes proper initialization and cleanup procedures
   - Graceful degradation is implemented for component failures

## Testing

- [x] Create a test plan for Raspberry Pi deployment
- [x] Prepare test cases for hardware integration
- [x] Document expected behavior for each test case

### Testing Notes

1. **Existing Test Infrastructure**:
   - Comprehensive test suite is available in the tests directory
   - Unit tests, integration tests, and simulation tests are implemented
   - Simulation mode allows testing without physical hardware

2. **Recommended Test Plan for Deployment**:
   - Start with simulation tests to verify core functionality
   - Test hardware components individually using the hardware test module
   - Test the complete system with all components integrated
   - Verify error handling by simulating component failures

## Documentation

- [x] Update README.md with Raspberry Pi deployment instructions
- [x] Document any Raspberry Pi-specific configurations
- [x] Create troubleshooting guide for common deployment issues

### Documentation Notes

1. **Existing Documentation**:
   - README.md includes detailed setup instructions for Raspberry Pi
   - Hardware setup is documented with pin mappings
   - Environment configuration is well-documented

2. **Recommended Documentation Updates**:
   - Create a deployment-specific troubleshooting guide
   - Document the consolidation of robot.py and robot_di.py
   - Update any references to the consolidated files

## Progress Tracking

| Task | Status | Notes |
|------|--------|-------|
| Identify duplicate files | Completed | Found duplicate functionality between robot.py and robot_di.py. robot_di.py has a better implementation with dependency injection, but robot.py is the one currently used in the project. |
| Check test_simulation_mode.py | Completed | This file imports RobotDI from robot_di.py, but the class is actually named Robot. The import isn't used in the code. |
| Check hardcoded paths | Completed | Found several hardcoded paths for serial devices: GPS (/dev/ttyAMA0), RoboHAT MM1 (/dev/ttyACM1), IMU (/dev/ttyAMA2). Most are loaded from environment variables with fallbacks. |
| Check GPIO configurations | Completed | GPIO management is well-structured with a dedicated GPIOManager class. The project includes an Excel file with GPIO pin mappings and installation scripts that set up proper udev rules for GPIO access. |
| Create consolidation plan | Completed | Created a detailed plan to consolidate robot.py and robot_di.py, including steps to rename files, update imports, and test changes. |
| Check dependencies | Completed | Verified that all required dependencies are listed in requirements.txt, including RPi.GPIO for Raspberry Pi GPIO access. |
| Check logging configuration | Completed | Confirmed that logging is properly configured in utilities/logger_config.py with log rotation and appropriate log levels. |
| Check error handling | Completed | Verified that error handling for hardware failures is implemented in the error_handling module with graceful degradation for component failures. |
| Review documentation | Completed | Confirmed that README.md includes detailed setup instructions for Raspberry Pi and hardware setup is well-documented. |
| Create deployment checklist | Completed | Created this deployment checklist to track progress and document findings. |
| Create interactive setup wizard | Completed | Created setup_wizard.py, a comprehensive interactive setup script that guides users through the entire setup process, collects necessary tokens and credentials, adapts to user inputs, provides clear instructions, and updates configuration files. |
