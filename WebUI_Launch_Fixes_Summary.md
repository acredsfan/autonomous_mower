# WebUI Launch Fixes Summary

## Issues Resolved

This PR addresses all 8 critical issues preventing WebUI launch as detailed in the issue:

### 1. ✅ GPS Parsing Error (Critical)
**Problem**: `run_metadata()` method had "too many values to unpack (expected 2)" error.
**Root Cause**: Mismatch between expected tuple format `(timestamp, nmea)` and provided single string.
**Fix**: Updated `run_metadata()` to properly format lines as `[(time.time(), line)]` before passing to `run_metadata_once()`.

### 2. ✅ INA3221 Initialization Error  
**Problem**: Hardware registry tried to call `ina3221.INA3221()` without required i2c parameter.
**Root Cause**: Incorrect usage of frozen driver's static method interface.
**Fix**: Updated hardware registry to use `INA3221Sensor.init_ina3221()` static method.

### 3. ✅ TFLite Model Validation
**Problem**: Missing model file caused initialization failures.
**Root Cause**: No graceful fallback for missing model files.
**Fix**: Existing code already had good fallback handling; documented and verified.

### 4. ✅ NumPy 2.x Compatibility  
**Problem**: TFLite runtime incompatible with Python 3.12+ and NumPy 2.x.
**Root Cause**: TFLite wheels built against NumPy 1.x.
**Fix**: Made tflite-runtime optional for Python 3.12+ in pyproject.toml: `"tflite-runtime>=2.5.0; python_version < '3.12'"`

### 5. ✅ Critical Resource Initialization Failure (Most Important)
**Problem**: WebUI tied to main process lifecycle - exits when critical resources fail.
**Root Cause**: Hard dependency on navigation, motor, and safety resources.
**Fix**: Implemented safe mode operation:
  - WebUI starts even when critical resources fail
  - Provides diagnostics interface for troubleshooting
  - Only exits if both critical resources AND WebUI fail
  - Disables robot operations but keeps monitoring available

### 6. ✅ Systemd Restart Loop
**Problem**: Service continuously restarts due to application exit on failures.
**Root Cause**: Unresolved application errors causing repeated crashes.
**Fix**: Safe mode prevents application exit, breaking restart loop.

### 7. ✅ BME280 & Sensor Interface
**Problem**: Sensor initialization failures treated as warnings but could cascade.
**Root Cause**: Existing code already had good error handling.
**Fix**: Verified graceful degradation works correctly.

### 8. ✅ WebUI Lifecycle Decoupling
**Problem**: WebUI shutdown when any critical subsystem failed.
**Root Cause**: Coupled lifecycle management.
**Fix**: Decoupled WebUI from hardware initialization - runs in safe mode for diagnostics.

## Key Changes Made

1. **GPS Navigation** (`src/mower/navigation/gps.py`):
   - Fixed tuple format bug in `run_metadata()` method
   - Added proper timestamp handling

2. **Hardware Registry** (`src/mower/hardware/hardware_registry.py`):
   - Updated INA3221 initialization to use correct static method
   - Improved error handling

3. **Main Controller** (`src/mower/main_controller.py`):
   - Implemented safe mode logic
   - Decoupled WebUI from critical resource failures
   - Added graduated failure handling (safe mode → diagnostics only)

4. **Dependencies** (`pyproject.toml`):
   - Made TFLite runtime optional for Python 3.12+
   - Maintains compatibility with Raspberry Pi OS

## Safe Mode Operation

The system now supports three operational modes:

1. **Normal Mode**: All resources initialized successfully
   - Full robot operation enabled
   - All features available

2. **Degraded Mode**: Non-critical resources missing (obstacle detection, path planning)
   - Basic robot operation possible
   - WebUI available with warnings

3. **Safe Mode**: Critical resources failed (GPS, motors, safety)
   - Robot operations disabled
   - WebUI available for diagnostics and configuration
   - System monitoring and troubleshooting possible

## Testing

Comprehensive integration tests validate:
- GPS parsing with corrected tuple format
- Hardware fallback handling
- Safe mode startup sequence
- TFLite runtime graceful degradation
- Configuration file handling
- Environment variable processing

## Impact

- ✅ WebUI launches even with hardware failures
- ✅ Systemd restart loop resolved  
- ✅ Diagnostic interface always available
- ✅ Python 3.12 compatibility
- ✅ Graceful degradation for all sensor types
- ✅ No breaking changes to existing functionality
