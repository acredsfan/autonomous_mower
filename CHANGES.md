# Changes

## Standardized Configuration Management

### Overview
Implemented standardized configuration management across all components to ensure consistent access to configuration values throughout the codebase.

### Changes Made
1. Updated `mower.py` to use the configuration management system:
   - Removed local `CONFIG_DIR` definition and imported it from `config_management`
   - Updated the `_load_config` method to use the configuration manager
   - Added a new `_save_config` method that uses the configuration manager
   - Updated methods that load and save configuration files to use the standardized approach:
     - `set_home_location`
     - `save_boundary`
     - `save_no_go_zones`
     - `set_mowing_schedule`
   - Updated component initialization to use `get_config` for configuration values

2. Created a test script (`test_config_management.py`) to verify the functionality of the standardized configuration management system.

3. Updated `tasks.md` to mark the "Standardize configuration management across all components" task as completed.

### Benefits
- Consistent approach to configuration management across all components
- Centralized configuration storage and access
- Improved error handling for configuration operations
- Support for hierarchical configuration keys
- Type conversion for configuration values
- Default values for missing configuration keys
- Thread-safe implementation for concurrent access

### Testing
The changes have been tested using the `test_config_management.py` script, which verifies:
- Initializing the configuration manager with default values
- Getting configuration values using `get_config`
- Setting configuration values using `set_config`
- Saving configuration to a file
- Loading configuration from a file

All tests pass, confirming that the standardized configuration management system works as expected.

## Added Type Hints to main_controller.py

### Overview
Added type hints to all functions and methods in the main_controller.py file to improve code readability, maintainability, and enable better IDE support and static type checking.

### Changes Made
1. Added necessary imports from the typing module:
   ```python
   from typing import Dict, Any, Optional, List, Tuple, Union, Type
   ```

2. Added type hints to all methods in the ResourceManager class:
   - __init__ method
   - _initialize_hardware method
   - _initialize_software method
   - initialize method
   - cleanup method
   - get_resource method
   - All get_* methods (get_path_planner, get_navigation, etc.)

3. Added type hints to all methods in the RobotController class:
   - __init__ method
   - _load_config method
   - run_robot method
   - _main_control_loop method
   - _check_emergency_conditions method
   - _check_at_home method
   - mow_yard method
   - _navigate_to_waypoint method
   - _return_home method
   - start_manual_control method
   - stop_all_operations method

4. Added type hints to the main function.

### Benefits
- Improved code readability and maintainability
- Better IDE support with autocompletion and error detection
- Enables static type checking with tools like mypy
- Helps catch type-related bugs early in development
- Serves as documentation for function parameters and return values

### Next Steps
This is the first step in adding type hints to the entire codebase. The following files still need type hints:
- Other core components like mower.py
- Hardware interface files
- Navigation and path planning modules
- Obstacle detection modules
- UI components
- Utility modules

## Fixed Circular Imports and Import Organization

### Overview
Fixed circular imports and inconsistent import paths in the codebase to improve maintainability, reduce potential runtime errors, and ensure consistent module importing across the project.

### Changes Made
1. Fixed inconsistent import in main_controller.py:
   - Updated the import of SerialPort to include GPS_BAUDRATE:
     ```python
     from mower.hardware.serial_port import SerialPort, GPS_BAUDRATE
     ```
   - Removed redundant import with inconsistent path:
     ```python
     from src.mower.hardware.serial_port import GPS_BAUDRATE
     ```

2. Fixed inconsistent import in navigation/gps.py:
   - Changed import with inconsistent path:
     ```python
     from src.mower.hardware.serial_port import SerialPort
     ```
     to:
     ```python
     from mower.hardware.serial_port import SerialPort
     ```

3. Fixed circular import between mower.py and robot.py:
   - Added a comment in mower.py to clarify the import location:
     ```python
     # Import here to avoid circular import
     from mower.robot import run_robot
     ```
   - This import is inside a function, which prevents the circular import from causing issues at module load time

4. Updated tasks.md to mark the "Fix circular imports and import organization" task as completed.

### Benefits
- Eliminated potential runtime errors caused by circular imports
- Improved code maintainability with consistent import paths
- Reduced module loading time by avoiding redundant imports
- Made the codebase more robust by preventing import-related issues
- Improved code readability with clear import organization
- Simplified dependency management
