# Changes Made to Autonomous Mower Project

## Core Structure Changes

1. **Consolidated mower.py and robot.py into main_controller.py**
   - Created a cleaner entry point for the application
   - Implemented a ResourceManager class to handle resource initialization
   - Implemented a RobotController class for core mowing logic
   - Eliminated global variables by using dependency injection

2. **Fixed IMU Initialization in hardware/imu.py**
   - Completely rewrote the BNO085Sensor class to use proper OOP practices
   - Added proper error handling and retry logic
   - Fixed serial port management to prevent resource leaks
   - Implemented singleton pattern properly
   - Added backwards compatibility functions for existing code

3. **Improved Path Handling**
   - Updated all file operations to use absolute paths
   - Created a dedicated config directory for JSON files
   - Fixed parameter order in circle_waypoints method in path_planning.py
   - Added more robust error handling for file operations

4. **Enhanced Thread Safety**
   - Added proper thread management in AvoidanceAlgorithm
   - Implemented stop mechanism for graceful shutdown
   - Added thread synchronization for shared resources

5. **Updated Dependencies Management**
   - Removed outdated requirements.txt file
   - Using setup.py as the single source of truth for dependencies

6. **Updated User Interface**
   - Modified WebInterface class to accept ResourceManager
   - Improved error handling in web interface components
   - Fixed path handling for storing user configurations

7. **Updated Documentation**
   - Updated README.md with correct entry point command
   - Added clear instructions for TensorFlow model path
   - Added project structure section
   - Updated Docker instructions

8. **Updated Docker Configuration**
   - Modified Dockerfile to use the new entry point
   - Added automatic model download in Docker build
   - Switched to using setup.py for dependency installation

## Key Benefits

1. **Improved Maintainability:**
   - Cleaner code organization with dependency injection
   - Explicit dependencies instead of global variables
   - Better error handling throughout the codebase

2. **Enhanced Reliability:**
   - Proper resource initialization and cleanup
   - Safer thread management
   - More robust path handling for configuration files

3. **Better Developer Experience:**
   - Clearer entry point for running the application
   - Improved documentation
   - Consistent dependency management

4. **Future-Proofing:**
   - Easier to add unit tests
   - Easier to add new components
   - Modular design allows for better scalability

## Next Steps

1. **Implement Testing Strategy:**
   - Add unit tests for core components
   - Add integration tests for major subsystems
   - Add mock hardware for testing without physical devices

2. **Further Refactor Global State:**
   - Continue reducing global variables in remaining modules
   - Apply dependency injection pattern more widely

3. **Enhance Error Recovery:**
   - Implement more sophisticated retry logic for hardware operations
   - Add failure mode handling for critical components

4. **Refine Threading Model:**
   - Review all threading code for potential race conditions
   - Consider using thread pools or async patterns where appropriate
