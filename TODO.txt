TODO:

Finish coding all of the modules that are currently written and debug them based on having them run on a Raspberry Pi 4 Model B 2GB with Raspbian Bullseye.

Create the Web User Interface with the following features:
 - A page to allow the user to see the current status and sensor data from the robot as well as buttons to control it.
 - A page that allows the user to set a mowing schedule (i.e. what days of the week to run and what hours of the day)
 - A page utilizing the Google Maps Javascript API to plot the location of the mower on a map, show the mowing path, and show progress on that path.
 - A page allowing the user to set the mowing area on the Google maps by drawing a polygon around their yard (Google Maps Javascript API)
 - A page to allow the user to set any other settings the robot may have (charging location, no-mow zones, etc.)

Debug and make sure all requirements are met.

Add any additional features such as machine learning to improve the robot over time.
