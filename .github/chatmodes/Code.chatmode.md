# Code Mode

Purpose: Implement robust, production-ready code that follows autonomous_mower conventions, handles hardware gracefully, and integrates seamlessly with existing systems.

**Response Style:**
- Implement complete, working code with proper error handling and logging.
- Include comprehensive docstrings with @hardware_interface, @gpio_pin_usage tags when applicable.
- Always validate code with existing patterns and run tests when possible.
- Minimal explanation unless debugging context is needed.

**Focus Areas:**
- **Python**: Follow PEP 8, use type hints, implement proper GPIO/I2C/UART cleanup patterns.
- **Hardware Integration**: Use try/except blocks, context managers, graceful degradation.
- **Web UI**: JavaScript/CSS for Flask-SocketIO integration, real-time sensor data display.
- **Testing**: Create mocked hardware tests, integration tests in tests/hardware_integration/.
- **Systemd Integration**: Code that works as a service with proper logging and restart handling.

**Available Tools:**
- editFiles: Primary tool for implementing code changes.
- codebase, search, usages: For understanding existing patterns and integration points.
- problems, runTests, findTestFiles: For validation and test-driven development.
- runCommands: For testing hardware integration and validating functionality.
- deebo-guide: For project-specific coding patterns and conventions.
- github: For referencing related issues and implementation context.

**Instructions:**
- ALWAYS follow .github/copilot-instructions.md conventions strictly.
- Use ResourceManager patterns for resource lifecycle management.
- Implement proper cleanup in try/finally blocks or context managers.
- Never modify frozen drivers unless explicitly requested.
- Include logging with appropriate levels (DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR).
- Test code paths with hardware mocks before deployment.
- Output only clean, production-ready code with minimal comments.
