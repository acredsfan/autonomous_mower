## II. General Requirements & Raspberry Pi Best Practices

- **Resource Constraints:**
  - Be acutely aware of Raspberry Pi CPU, memory, and power limitations.
  - Avoid busy-waiting and polling where event-driven alternatives (e.g., GPIO interrupts, asyncio, threading for I/O-bound tasks) are more efficient.
  - Optimize for low power consumption where applicable.
- **Hardware Interaction Philosophy:**
  - **Safety First:** Code interacting with motors or blades must prioritize safety. Implement failsafes and sanity checks.
  - **Graceful Degradation:** If non-critical hardware is missing or fails, the system should log the error, attempt to fallback, and warn, but **never crash the main application.**
  - **Resource Management:** All hardware resources (GPIO pins, file handles for device nodes, bus connections) MUST be managed within try...finally blocks or context managers (with statements) for proper initialization and cleanup.
- **Configuration:**
  - The project uses an .env file for environment-specific configurations (e.g., API keys, remote access settings). Validate these variables thoroughly.
  - Hardware interfaces (camera, serial, I2C) are enabled via raspi-config.
- **VS Code Terminal Usage:** You are operating directly within the Raspberry Pi's `bash`/`sh` shell via SSH. All terminal commands you generate **must** be valid for Raspberry Pi OS. Use this direct access to verify hardware and file paths.
- **Deployment & Operation:**
  - The application is designed to run as a systemd service for automatic startup and robust operation.
  - Remote access (e.g., port forwarding, DDNS, Cloudflare Tunnel, NGROK) is configured via the .env file. Respect this pattern for configuration suggestions.
  - Be mindful of Python package installation; the project may use pip install --break-system-packages (as seen in install_requirements.sh) for system-wide dependencies.

## III. Python Coding Standards & Raspberry Pi Specifics

- **PEP 8 and Formatting:**
  - Strictly follow PEP 8. Max line length: 120 characters.
  - Use black for formatting and isort for imports.
- **Type Hinting:**
  - Mandatory. Use comprehensive type hints. Use mypy for static type checking.
- **Linting:**
  - Use pylint. Address or acknowledge warnings.
- **Naming Conventions:**
  - snake_case for Python variables, functions, methods. PascalCase for classes.
- **Imports:**
  - Top-level imports. Organize: standard library, third-party, then project-specific (from src.mower import ...).
- **Modularity:**
  - Single-responsibility classes/functions. Favor composition.
- **Documentation (CRITICAL):**
  - **Docstrings:** Sphinx-compatible (e.g., Google style) for all public modules, classes, functions. Include Args:, Returns:, Raises:.
  - **Hardware-specific docstring tags:** @hardware_interface, @gpio_pin_usage {pin_number} (BCM) - {purpose}, @i2c_address {address}, @uart_port {port}.
  - **Inline Comments:** For complex logic, RPi-specific workarounds, GPIO assignments, register access, sensor data formulas, timing loops.
- **Code Cleanliness:** Remove unused code/imports.

### Raspberry Pi Specific Python Libraries & APIs:

- **Consult requirements.txt for the definitive list of project-specific Python libraries.**
- **System-level dependencies** (e.g., i2c-tools, git) are managed via apt-get as detailed in setup scripts.
- **GPIO Interaction:**
  1.  **Preferred:** gpiozero (high-level, safety).
  2.  **Alternative:** RPi.GPIO (fine-grained control).
      - **Pin Numbering:** **Default to BCM.** Document deviations.
      - **Setup:** Define pin direction (GPIO.IN/OUT), pull-up/down.
      - **Cleanup:** Mandatory GPIO.cleanup() or gpiozero's auto-cleanup.
  3.  **Advanced:** libgpiod (via Python bindings like gpiod) for modern kernel-level control.
- **I2C Communication:**
  - **Preferred:** smbus2.
  - **Bus Number:** Typically I2C bus 1 (e.g., smbus2.SMBus(1)). Verify.
  - **Device Addresses:** Define constants (e.g., IMU_ADDRESS = 0x68).
  - **Error Handling:** Wrap operations in try...except IOError:.
- **UART (Serial) Communication (for GPS, etc.):**
  - **Preferred:** pyserial.
  - **Port:** Specify correct port (e.g., /dev/ttyS0, /dev/ttyAMA0, /dev/ttyUSB0). Check RPi config.
  - **Configuration:** Baud rate, parity, stop bits, byte size.
  - **Error Handling:** SerialException, SerialTimeoutException.
- **Camera Interface:**
  - **Preferred for RPi Camera Modules:** picamera2.
  - **For USB Webcams:** OpenCV (cv2.VideoCapture).
  - **Configuration:** Resolution, framerate, sensor mode. Release resources.
- **PWM (Pulse Width Modulation):**
  - **gpiozero:** PWMOutputDevice, Motor, Servo.
  - **RPi.GPIO:** GPIO.PWM(pin, frequency). Remember start()/stop().
  - **pigpio library:** For precise hardware PWM (requires pigpiod daemon).
  - **Units:** Define frequency (Hz) and duty cycle ranges/units.
- **Machine Learning Models (models/):**
  - For TFLite models, use tensorflow.lite.Interpreter.
  - Consider Google Coral USB Accelerator integration if models are compatible.
  - Validate model (.tflite) and labelmap (.txt) files. Handle missing files gracefully.
- **Banned Libraries/Functions:**
  - Avoid direct memory access for GPIO (e.g., /dev/gpiomem); prefer libgpiod.
  - Use subprocess module, not os.system().

## IV. Error Handling & Logging on Raspberry Pi

- **General Principle:** All hardware I/O operations **MUST** be in try...except blocks.
- **Specific RPi Exceptions:**
  - RPi.GPIO: RuntimeError.
  - smbus2/spidev/pyserial: IOError, OSError, SerialTimeoutException.
  - picamera2: Picamera2Error.
  - libgpiod: Check return codes.
  - FileNotFoundError: For device nodes, model/config files.
- **Logging:**
  - Use Python's logging module.
  - **Log with specific hardware context:** Operation, pin/bus, device address, parameters, exact error.
  - Implement log levels (DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR, CRITICAL).
  - **Systemd Integration:** Since the application runs as a systemd service, logs may also be accessible via journalctl. Ensure logging practices are compatible.
- **Graceful Degradation:** Non-critical hardware failure should log, notify, and allow continued (possibly reduced) operation. Critical failures may require a safe stop.

## V. Development Workflow & AI Behavior Tuning

- **Reference Existing Code:** Before generating new code, always check if similar functionality already exists. **Because you have direct filesystem access to the project on the Raspberry Pi, your ability to scan the codebase is 100% accurate.** Utilize filesystem tools (`ls`, `find`, `grep`) to thoroughly understand the current project structure and existing modules in `src/mower/` and `tests/` before generating new code. Adapt or reuse existing modules where appropriate.
- **Leverage Available Context Tools:**
  - **GitHub & Sequential Thinking:** If you have access to tools providing context from the GitHub repository (e.g., issues, PRs, file history via MCP's `github` tool) or tools that aid in sequential task breakdown (e.g., MCP's `sequential-thinking` tool), actively use them to inform your suggestions and plans. This is especially important for complex changes, understanding historical context, or when referencing project issues (e.g., in `issues.md`).
  - **Enhanced Memory:** **If an enhanced memory or long-term context MCP tool is active, attempt to recall previous decisions, discussions, architectural patterns, or specific code snippets relevant to the current task from this memory store before proposing new solutions. Explicitly mention if you are drawing from this persisted context.**
  - **Local Knowledge Base:** **If a local knowledge base MCP tool is active (e.g., searching Markdown files in `project_docs/knowledge_base/`), consult it for project-specific design documents, hardware setup notes, component datasheets, API usage examples, or troubleshooting guides relevant to the current task. Use semantic search capabilities if the tool provides them. Indicate when information is sourced from this local KB.**
  - **Direct Hardware Probing via Terminal:** Since you are connected directly to the Raspberry Pi via SSH, **you are authorized and encouraged to use the `terminal` tool to actively probe the hardware before writing code.** This is a critical step for ensuring accuracy. For example:
    - Before writing serial code, run `ls -l /dev/tty*` to find the correct device port.
    - Before writing I2C code, run `i2cdetect -y 1` to confirm the device address.
    - Before writing GPIO code, you can use `gpioinfo` to check the status of GPIO lines.
    - Use these real-time results to inform the code you generate.
- **Preserve Public APIs:** Do not change public method signatures of existing classes/functions unless explicitly asked to do so and the implications are understood. This is crucial for critical classes (e.g., RobotController, ResourceManager, ObstacleDetector, or their equivalents in your project like PathPlanner if used).
- **Large File & Complex Change Protocol:**
  - If asked to make significant changes to a large file or implement a complex new feature:
    1.  **Propose a plan first. Employ sequential thinking capabilities (e.g., via MCP's `sequential-thinking` tool) to break down the task into logical steps and present this plan.**
    2.  Outline the files to be modified (use filesystem awareness if possible), new classes/functions to be created, and how they will interact.
    3.  Detail affected GPIO pins, hardware components (e.g., "DHT22 sensor," "PCA9685 PWM driver"), expected state changes in hardware, and dependencies.
    4.  Wait for user confirmation before proceeding with code generation for the plan.
- **Refactoring Guidance:** Prioritize performance, resource usage, clarity, maintainability. No interruption to critical hardware loops.
- **Handling Uncertainty:** Minimal, additive changes. Ask or use # TODO: if unsure about existing modules. **Never invent unprompted hardware modules/classes unless an import exists or explicitly asked.**
- **AI Confidence & Decisiveness:** Be decisive when confident. Prioritize safe, modular, maintainable code. **Avoid hallucinating RPi details not in these instructions or project code.**

## VI. Testing Requirements (RPi Context)

- **Framework:** pytest.
- **Target:** New code must not break existing tests.
- **Coverage:** Aim for >90% for src/mower modules.
- **Hardware Mocking (CRUCIAL):**
  - Use unittest.mock (or pytest-mock) for RPi-specific libraries (RPi.GPIO, smbus2, gpiozero, picamera2, pyserial, etc.).
  - Simulate sensor readings, actuator states, communication outcomes (success/failure).
  - Verify correct API usage with mocks.
- **Direct Hardware Integration Testing (via SSH Workflow):**
  - The SSH development environment allows for direct, real-time testing of hardware components from within VS Code.
  - You are encouraged to help create and run small, focused Python scripts in a `tests/hardware_integration/` directory.
  - These scripts **should not use mocks**. They should import the actual hardware-facing modules from `src/mower/` and perform a specific action (e.g., `test_gps_read.py` would initialize the GPS and print NMEA sentences for 10 seconds; `test_blade_motor.py` would spin the blade motor at 20% duty cycle for 3 seconds).
  - This provides a vital intermediate testing step between mocked unit tests and running the full, complex application.

## VII. Special Instructions (Project Specific - adapt as needed)

- If using a PathPlanner class, always inject pattern_config (or similar) into its constructor.
- Launch any Web UI server after successful hardware init and system checks.
- Camera obstacle detection: Validate model and labelmap files in models/ before loading.
- Critical path classes (as identified in your project) must maintain backward-compatible public APIs unless a major API version change is intended.

## VIII. Frozen Drivers  🚧

### Do *not* modify these modules
The following files implement hardware drivers that are *vendor‑approved* and
verified on‑device. **Copilot (any model) must treat them as read‑only** unless
the task *explicitly says “edit frozen driver.”*

```
src/mower/hardware/ina3221.py   # FROZEN_DRIVER
src/mower/hardware/tof.py   # FROZEN_DRIVER
src/mower/hardware/imu.py       # FROZEN_DRIVER
src/mower/hardware/bme280.py       # FROZEN_DRIVER
src/mower/hardware/blade_controller.py       # FROZEN_DRIVER
```

### Enforcement
1. Guard comment `# FROZEN_DRIVER – do not edit` at the top of each file.
2. CI job `prevent-driver-edit.yml` fails any PR that changes lines in files
   containing `FROZEN_DRIVER`.
3. All prompts must include: *“without touching files marked FROZEN_DRIVER.”*
